# Spend_Score_Analysis
Analysing spend score for a set of customers in a mall and grouping them using K-Means clustering algorithms.
•	I have attached my solution file(.ipynb), dataset file(.csv), and results(.PNG).
•	I have used K-Means Clustering Algorithm to classify the 'Spending Score' class of the used dataset, i.e.  Mall_Customers.csv. 
•	The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and contains 200 rows and 5 columns. 
•	I have used 'Elbow Method' to optimize parameter, to identify the optimum K value for the training dataset.
•	The obtained result in the form of clustering have also been attached.
